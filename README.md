# PHYLAX: The Sovereign Integrity Protocol
**A Hardware-Enforced Identity Shield for National Security**

## 🛡️ Strategic Mission: Integrity over Inquiry
PHYLAX (Project SENTINEL) replaces the catastrophic costs of reactive "Public Inquiries" with hardware-enforced accountability. 

| Feature | Reactive (Traditional) | Proactive (PHYLAX) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | **£10M – £150M+** per Inquiry | **£550,000** Pilot Phase |
| **Integrity** | "Soft" logs (editable) | Hardware-rooted (Immutable) |
| **Resolution** | Years of litigation | Instant mathematical proof |
