# PHYLAX: The Sovereign Integrity Protocol

**Status:** Compliance Alignment (UK Cyber Security Bill 2026)  
**Core Architecture:** RISC-V | TPM 2.0 | Volatile Edge Processing

## 🛡️ Strategic Focus: Inquiry vs. Integrity
PHYLAX (Project SENTINEL) replaces the catastrophic costs of reactive "Public Inquiries" with hardware-enforced "Immutable Auditing." By rooting the chain of trust in the silicon, we provide a mathematical proof of system state that cannot be altered by foreign state actors or internal corruption.

## 🇬🇧 National Security Alignment
* **Anti-Espionage:** Hardware-level memory isolation (PMP) prevents remote-access hijacks.
* **Tactical Enforcement:** Offline-first biometric matching for high-risk zones and KCPO enforcement.
* **Sovereignty:** 100% auditable RTL code, eliminating dependency on "Black Box" foreign hardware.
