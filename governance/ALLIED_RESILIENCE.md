Strategic Governance & Allied Resilience Statement

Project: Phylax Sentinel Core / Legacy Architecture

Author: Joel Garcia (Phylax Cybernetics)

Status: 2026 Strategic Compliance Research

1. Purpose: This research is developed to solve the "Sovereignty Gap" for NATO allies (specifically the UK/EU). It is designed to allow US-based multinationals to operate in high-compliance regions without violating the EU AI Act or emerging Florida AI Bill of Rights mandates regarding data security.

2. The "Verify & Discard" Protocol: Unlike standard AI models that harvest data, this project utilizes a hardware-bound, RAM-only architecture. This ensures that personal identifying information is never stored or shared with third parties, aligning with 2026 consumer protection standards.

3. Technical Transparency: By utilizing Open RISC-V Architecture and European-Sovereign Silicon (STMicroelectronics), the Sentinel Core ensures 100% auditability. This provides a "Technical Safe Harbor" for companies under CFIUS review, proving that US user data remains isolated from foreign interference.

4. Allied Interoperability: This is a tool for Resilience. By building hardware that does not require a US-cloud heartbeat, we ensure that allied security infrastructure remains functional during global outages or supply chain disruptions.
