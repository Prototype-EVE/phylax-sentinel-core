1. Mission Intent: Supporting Allied Sovereignty
The research contained in this repository is developed under the principle of Allied Resilience. In an era of global supply chain instability, it is a strategic necessity for NATO allies (specifically the UK and EU) to maintain "Digital Sovereignty"—the ability to secure their own borders and data without total dependency on foreign-hosted cloud infrastructure.

This project is not a tool for isolation; it is a tool for interoperability. By solving for the world’s strictest privacy mandates (GDPR / EU AI Act), we create a "Global Gold Standard" for security that protects both US and European interests simultaneously.

2. Addressing the "Access" Question: Can the US use this?
Yes. Under the MIT License, this technology is open and accessible to US government agencies and private corporations.

The "Privacy Neutral" Design: The reason this tech is framed as "Sovereign" is because it enforces Data Minimization. If the US government utilizes this stack, they benefit from the same "Verify & Discard" protections, ensuring that US citizen data is handled with the same high level of constitutional privacy as their European counterparts.

A Bridge, Not a Wall: By creating a system that is "decoupled" from specific cloud monopolies, we ensure that in the event of a global cyber-outage or geopolitical friction, US-based multinationals (like Electronic Arts) can continue to operate securely across the Atlantic.

3. Monitoring, Tracking, and Accountability
A common question for "Edge-AI" or "Offline-First" systems is: "How do we know it’s being used correctly if it’s not connected to the internet?" * Cryptographic Accountability: The system utilizes Pseudonymous Officer Logging. Every scan generates a cryptographically signed "Math Receipt." While the subject's biometric data is deleted in <0.5s, the metadata of the scan (Time, Location, Officer ID) is logged to a tamper-proof internal ledger.

Auditability: Because the core is built on Open RISC-V Architecture, it is fully auditable by authorized agencies (e.g., NCSC in the UK or CISA in the US). There are no "black box" algorithms; the logic is transparent and verifiable by our allies.

4. Legal & Ethics Disclosure
Non-Adversarial Use: This research is intended for defensive security, compliance automation, and IP preservation. It is not designed to bypass, evade, or undermine the sovereign laws of the United States or its allies.

Commitment to the Special Relationship: As a US-based researcher, my work aims to strengthen the technical bond between the US and UK by providing the tools necessary for a secure, autonomous, and resilient democratic future.
