Subject: Fiscal Displacement: Proactive Integrity vs. Reactive Inquiry Costs

Executive Summary: The UK’s current approach to institutional data integrity is reactive, relying on modifiable digital logs and foreign cloud providers. When these systems fail—as seen in recent scandals or data-integrity crises—the government is forced into multi-year Public Inquiries. Project SENTINEL provides an "Exit Ramp" by hard-coding accountability into the hardware itself.

The "Inquiry vs. Integrity" Cost Comparison:

The Reactive Model (The Inquiry): Public inquiries into data failures and internal scandals typically cost the UK taxpayer between £10M and £150M+.

The Proactive Model (The PHYLAX Protocol): A full-scale Sovereign Pilot for Project SENTINEL costs £550,000.

The Outcome: For less than 1% of the cost of a single inquiry, the UK can deploy "Immutable Auditing." Because the logs are rooted in the RISC-V silicon and locked by TPM 2.0, tampering is physically impossible.
