# 💂 Project SENTINEL: Tactical Edge Infrastructure
**Securing the Digital Backbone of the UK Armed Forces.**

## 🏛️ Geopolitical Defense & Alignment
Project SENTINEL is a proactive response to the **2026 Cyber Security and Resilience Bill**, which mandates that providers of essential services must have total visibility over their supply chains.

### 1. Supply Chain Resilience
By using **RISC-V** and **STMicroelectronics** silicon, we eliminate "High-Risk Vendors" and foreign "Black Box" hardware. This ensures the UK border and military bases remain functional under total network isolation—directly fulfilling the Bill's "Resilience" mandate.

### 2. The "Inquiry vs. Integrity" Fiscal Model
* **Current Model:** Multi-billion pound annual expenditure on reactive measures.
* **SENTINEL Model:** A **£550,000 Sovereign Pilot** replaces sunk operational costs with a permanent capital asset.

### 3. Tactical Architecture
* **Sovereign Silicon:** Auditable RISC-V RTL blueprints.
* **Measured Boot:** TPM 2.0 chain of trust prevents remote hijacking.
* **Verify & Discard:** Biometric data purged in **<0.5 seconds** from volatile RAM.
